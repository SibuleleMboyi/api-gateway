Circuit Breaker

What if one of the services is down or is slow?
    - It impacts the entire chain.

Questions:-
    - Can we return a fallback response if a service is down?
    - Can we implement a Circuit Breaker pattern to reduce load
        ( i.e Avoid making further requests once we are aware that the service is permanently down) ?
    - Can we retry requests in case of temporary failures?
    - Can we implement rate limiting? (i.e allowing a certain number of requests in a period of time)
