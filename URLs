    Eureka Naming Server:
        http://localhost:8761/
    API Gateway:
        1) http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/jpa-currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
        2) http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/100

    Currency-Exchange:
        http://localhost:8000/jpa-currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

    Currency-Conversion:
        http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/200
        

- To format our URLs, in the application.properties file, we allow URLs to be lowercase.
- So instead of a service name "CURRENCY-EXCHANGE" as registered in Eureka Naming Server Micro-Service()
- We lowercase this name to "currency-exchange".
- Therefore our URLs become :-
    1) http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/jpa-currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR

    2) http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/100
