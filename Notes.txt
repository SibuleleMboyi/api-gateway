IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT SECURITY, it must be here in the API Gateway

1) The API Gateway Micro-Service acts as a standard port for all our Micro-Services.
2) Instead of having each Micro-Service being called from it's individual configured port,
3) We expose all our Micro-Services to the Eureka Naming Server.

4) We configure the API Gateway Micro-Service to talk communicate with the Eureka Naming Server.
5) The API Gateway then gets all the Micro-Services URLs and expose them via it's port.
